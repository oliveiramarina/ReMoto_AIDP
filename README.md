# ReMoto_AIDP

This Fortran program was developed by R.N. Watanabe and M.C. de Oliveira based on a previous ReMoto simulator developed in Java (see Cisi & Kohn, Journal of Computational Neuroscience 25 (3), 520-542, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10827-008-0092-8). The adaptation of ReMoto to simulate demyelinating diseases with a focus on studies of force and position tasks among other quantifiers was realised by Marina C. de Oliveira, with the collaboration of R.N Watanabe and A.F. Kohn.

The original model for healthy subjects only can be seen in https://github.com/rnwatanabe/projectFR.
